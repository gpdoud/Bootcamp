# Purchase Request System (PRS)

This is a guide to building the PRS system in .Net & Angular

To organize the entire project, it is recommended to create a folder called `prs` in the `repos` folder. This should **not** be a repository! It is only for organizing the two parts of the project.

## Back-end (C#,EF,MVC,WebApi,Sql Server)

## Front-end (Angular,Typescript)

At this time, the current versions of Angular is v7.1.4.

### Generate the Angular project files

Change directory so that the current directory is `/c/repos/prs`.

From the Git Bash Shell, type:

```
ng new prs-client --routing
```

This will create the default project files including providing support for running as a single-page application (SPA) by providing routing.

### Add required modules

To allow the required functionality, a couple of Angular modules are required:

* **FormsModule** - supports two-way binding
* **HttpClientModule** - supports AJAX calls to back-end service

Navigate to the `prs-client/src/app` folder.

Edit `app.module.ts`.

Add the following import statements to `app.module.ts`.

```
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
```

Once the import statements are added, the class names must be added to the `imports` key in the `@NgModule` decorator.

*Note: The `imports` key will already contain the `BrowserModule` class name. This should remain the 1st class name in the `imports` array list. Add new module names **after** the `BrowserModule`.*

```
imports: [ FormsModule, HttpClientModule ]
```

### Options for organizing the project structure

There are many ways an Angular project can be structured. There is no particular **best** way but there are two general ways to organize the files.

* By *object* type - Organizing by *object* type means putting all *components* into a folder possibly with subfolder within it and doing the same of *modules*.

* By *functional* type - Organizing by *functional* area means putting all the object related to *user* into a folder. This is the recommended way.

### Creating folder for functional project structure

The functional objects in the prs application are: *user*, *vendor*, *product*, *request*, *requestLine*. In fact, the *requestLine* could be considered part of the *request*.

Create the following folders:

```
/prs-client/src/app/user
/prs-client/src/app/vendor
/prs-client/src/app/product
/prs-client/src/app/request
/prs-client/src/app/requestLine
```
### Create the User class

To follow the naming standard set for other object in Angular, the recommended way to name the User class and the other classes is: 

```
user.class.ts
```

While classes can be generated by the cli utility, there is not much benefit in doing so. I suggest just creating a new file from Visual Studio Code.

```
| id |
| --- |
```
export class User {

    id: number;
    username: string;
    password: string;
    firstname: string;
    lastname: string;
    phone: string;
    email: string;
    isReviewer: boolean;
    isAdmin: boolean;
    active: boolean;

    constructor(username: string, password: string,
                firstname: string, lastname: string,
                phone: string, email: string,
                isReviewer: boolean = false, 
                isAdmin: boolean = false, 
                active: boolean = true
    ) {
        this.id = 0;
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
        this.firstname = firstname;
        this.lastname = lastname;
        this.phone = phone;
        this.email = email;
        this.isReviewer = isReviewer;
        this.isAdmin = isAdmin;
        this.active = active;
    }
}
