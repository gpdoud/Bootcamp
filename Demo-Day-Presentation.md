## Demo - A day in the life ...

Whenever you present, you need to know your audience. That means you understand what they know and don't know and you deliver your presentation using words and concepts you understand. You don't use acronymns your audience are not familiar with.

The audience for demo day is typically individuals from Human Resources departments and Recruiters from staffing firms. These people, while knowledgeable on the topics of software development are not programmers. And so, the presentations and demo cannot be technically-based. For example, there is no reason to talk in detail about how data read asynchronously by Angular. 

The demo also should not be feature-based. We should not just list out features of the application like the ability to login showing a list of data for all the tables. This approach would only be useful in a scenario where the audience is looking for and knows about the features of other software product like the one you're presenting and wants to compare your features against others. That is not the case at demo day.

Instead, the best way to demo PRS is by doing a "Day in the life". This presents how the software would be used in a real-world situation within a company. Since everyone in attendance will be from a company, they will understand the benefits the software may bring. The audience will stay more engaged during the demo.

## Scenarios for Day in the life

Students can make up whatever scenario they like, but other boot camps have consistently used one scenario very effectively. 

    It is a new employee's first day on the job. He meets the boss who shows him the new office including the one assigned to him, but it is in the brand new wing and has no furniture in it. So he gets to pick out that funiture and other supplies for her office. She describes the new Purchase Request System they've built to make it easier for employees to do so. It replaces the old filling out forms and passing those forms around to others where they got lost and data was transcribed incorrectly. The old system gave them lots of problems. The new PRS makes things much better. She steps him through using the system and picking product for his new office.

    She explains the business rules that any request over $50 must be approved by her.

Previous boot camps have taken license to add a touch of humor to their presentations and demos. When it works, it keeps the audience's attention.
