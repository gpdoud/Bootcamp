# Capstone Certification

The capstone project is the most important requirement as it demonstrates the student's skill using all they have learned in the boot camp.

## Requirements

The following are required functions of the capstone and will be checked by the instructor. An `item` may be a `user`, `vendor`, `product`, or `request`.

- Demonstrating an unsuccessful login
- Demonstrating a successful login
- Displaying all items of a type
- Displaying the detail of a single item
- Creating a new item
- Creating a request is automatically owned by the logged in user
- Creating/changing or deleting a line on a request recalculates the request total correctly
- Setting a request with a total less than or equal to $50 sets the status to APPROVED automatically
- Setting a request with a total greater than $50 sets the status to REVIEW automatically
- Displaying a list of requests in REVIEW status excludes requests owned by the logged in user
- Rejecting a request sets the status to REJECTED, requires text in the `rejectionReason` property, and displays the `rejectionReason` on the request detail component
- Approving a request sets the status to APPROVED.

## Grading

When the student feels that their capstone project is complete, the student will request a review from the instructor. 

The student will run their project on their laptop with the instructor looking at the screen. 

The instructor will direct the student to show various functions of the capstone project. Each function is worth either 5, 10, or 15 points. The instructor may award partial points for a function that works completely. There are 100 points available and the student needs 80 points to receive certification.

Once the capstone is certified, the student is free to continue to modify/enhance the capstone project.
