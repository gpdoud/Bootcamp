Hi. My name is Greg Doud and I'm the Senior Instructor for this boot camp.

I know that many of you are familiar with the MAXimum boot camp but for those that are not, I'll tell you a little about it.

To start, I want to say that the boot camp is very hard. It is 13 weeks from 9am to 4:30pm with a lot of coding. We cover about a dozen programming topics, and we go very quickly through instruction and coding which is the primary reason that the boot camp is so hard.

To graduate, the students must pass 5 technical assessments and have their final capstone project certified. This capstone project is designed by MAX and all students do the same project. It is a three-tier, full-stack, RESTful web application and all students do it using both C# and Java. It is no trivial project. All students wrote every line of code in their capstone project.

Now, we'll bring on the students to have them tell you about themselves.
