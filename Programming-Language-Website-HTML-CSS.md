# Programming Language Website with HTML/CSS & Bootstrap

Create a website detailing one programming language. The programming language is selected from the following programming languages:

    `Assembler, Ada, Basic, C, C++, C#, COBOL, Elm, F#, Fortran, Go, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Lisp, Pascal, Perl, PL/1, Python, RPG, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Smalltalk, SQL, Swift (Apple), Typescript, Visual Basic, Webassembly`

All web pages should have a common look and feel from the user's persepective (similar fonts, colors, styles, etc.) Bootstrap should be the primary tool for styling the pages.

It is encouraged to use use images and other multimedia in all pages. A page composed of all text is strongly discouraged. 

## Website structure

The site should have a home page which provides some introduction to the programming language selected and a menu that allows the user to navigate to other pages. The home page should allow navigation to the other pages. Every page should allow navigation to the home page. Optionally, detail pages may allow navigation to other detail pages. Ideally, this navigation would be done via a menu that appears in the same location on every page.

## Detail pages

At a minimum, the following detail pages should be available on the site.

### Features of the language

* Who created the language?
* For what purpose was it created?
* Why was it created?
* Was it based on some other language?
* Is the language compiled or interpreted?

### History of the language

* What events caused the language to be developed?
* How did the language evolve over time?
* Is the language still is use today?

### Examples of the language

This page is likely to be long. As such, you should consider using hyperlinks (<a>) to help navigate to different parts of the page.

* "Hello, world!"
* Data Types (like int, string, date, etc.)
* Control constructs (if, while, for, etc.)
