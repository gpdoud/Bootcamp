# ToDo Application

The Todo application is a task list manager. ToDo is a  multi-user web application.

## Requirements

The team will work on this single application that must use only a single repository from the back-end and a single repository for the front-end. The architecture of the application is the same as the capstone project.

The team will use Scrum to manage the process. The dev team will decide who does what work on the project. Greg will be the Scrum Master and Product Owner.

## Features

* The system is multi-user so a user must log in successfully to access the system
* Any user can create, modify, and delete their own todos.
* Todo items have a target date for completion.
* A user can assign a todo to another user who may accept or reject the todo
* Users can choose to see all todos or only those not completed.

## Tips for team development

* One user should create the template repositories including directories and push them to GitHub.
* Other developers must be made collaborators in those repositories
* All developers should do their work in a branch, push the branch to GitHub, and create a "Pull Request"
* Only a limited number of developers should be able to merge the pull request.
* After a pull request is merged, all developers must do a `git pull ...` to get the most current code.
