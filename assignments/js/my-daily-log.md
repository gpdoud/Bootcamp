# My Daily Log

Write a program that displays a list of what programming you did each day of the week.

The data will contain the date (mm/dd) and some text. Here is an example.

{ date: '12/29', note: 'I wrote a sort routine' }

Everytime a new item is created, it is stored in an array within the program code.

The page should display all the items currently in the array.

The bottom of the page should have two text boxes for the date and note along with a button to save the data into the array. The saved item should display in the list immediately.
