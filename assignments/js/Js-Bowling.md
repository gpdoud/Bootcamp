# Assignment: Js-Bowling

Your assignment is to create a page that displays the score for one game of bowling. You get the score for each frame by generating a random number from the Math library. The code to generate an integer number between 0 and 30 is:

    var score = Math.floor(Math.random() * 31);

Since there are 10 frames in a game of bowling, you need to generate 10 random numbers. When all the numbers have been generated, you must sum all the numbers to get the game score. Finally, display the scores for each frame and the game score on the web page.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 145 |
