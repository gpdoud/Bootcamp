# Packing the payload

Calculate the minimum number of boxes to contain a particular payload.

- A large box can contain 4 to 6 items
- A small box can contain only 1 item.

## Example 

A payload of 39 items can be packed in 5 boxes of 6 (30), 1 box of five (35), and 1 box of 4 (39) for a total of 7 boxes.

An answer of 6 boxes of 6 (36) and 3 boxes of 1 (39) for a total of 9 would be incorrect.

## Sample Payloads

| Payload | Lg6 | Lg5 | Lg4 | S1  | Total|
| ---     | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   2     |   0 |   0 |   0 |   2 |   2 |
|   5     |   0 |   1 |   0 |   0 |   1 |
|   9     |   0 |   1 |   1 |   0 |   2 |
|  17     |   2 |   1 |   0 |   0 |   3 |
|  33     |   4 |   1 |   1 |   0 |   6 |
|  52     |   8 |   0 |   1 |   0 |   9 |
