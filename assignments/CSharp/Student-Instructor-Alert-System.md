# Student/Instructor Alert System (SIAS)

This is a software product that I've been thinking about writing myself but have not taken the time to do so.

The purpose of the system is to allow students in a boot camp to communicate with the instructor that the student is keeping up with the pace of the instructor, or the student is having trouble keeping up with the pace, or that the student cannot keep up with the pace.

The way this will work by providing an application that let the users click on a stop light (red, yellow, green) that will display to the instructor. When green, the student indicates that the pace of instruction is just fine. When yellow, the student indicates that they are having difficulty understanding and/or keeping up with the instruction. When red, the student indicates they do not understand the instructor and/or that they cannot keep up with the instruction.

The instruction's user interface will show the traffic light indicator for all the students at the same time.

## Technology

- It is envisioned that because the student's response must be seen by the instrctor in real time, this will be a web application with a common database.
- The project will use a GitHub repository in Greg's repository.

## Functionality

- A student must sign into the system each day.
- The students interface will start green
- The student simply clicks on any color to change it
- The student will be prompted to reset their color every 15 minutes
- The instruction may reset a students color to green after changing instruction
