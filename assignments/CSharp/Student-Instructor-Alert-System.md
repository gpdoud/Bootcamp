# Student/Instructor Alert System (SIAS)

This is a software product that I've been thinking about writing myself but have not taken the time to do so.

The purpose of the system is to allow students in a boot camp to communicate with the instructor that the student is keeping up with the pace of the instructor, or the student is having trouble keeping up with the pace, or that the student cannot keep up with the pace.
