# MyCV HTML

Your task is to create your resume in a web page using only HTML

It should have the following sections:

* Contact info
* Technology list
* Work experience
* Education

It should be organized just like your printed resume.

Because no CSS will be used, the concern is only to layout the information relative to all other information. Meaning the contact info should be first followed by the technology list.
