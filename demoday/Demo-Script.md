# Demo "Day in the life"

For the Demo Day demo, it is important to remember a couple of things:

    - The audience are not programmers and most are not that technical
    - Many will have seen the software demonstrated many times
    - They are not purchasing agents and are not looking to buy your softwarer
    - They are more interested in seeing you present than what you're presenting

Given these things, the only way to keep the audience's attention is to focus on what the software does and not how it does it. There is no reason to talk about how the user login is done. Instead, you should talk about how the software can only be used by those that are given access to the system.

Below is a script that many previous classes have used to great success. A few items that help make the demonstration more successful:

    - Act like you're enjoying yourself and smile
    - Add a touch of self deprecating humor. It helps the audience pay attention
    - Even though you will not have the audience in the room, make some eye contact by looking directly into the camera.
    - The smoother the interaction, the better the audience likes it.

The setup is you belong to a company that has just implemented a new Purchase Request System and ditched the old paper system of letting employees request the items they need. Some of the problems with the paper-based system was that the papers got lost, the people that had to handle them went on vacation and the papers just sat on their desk, information got transposed incorrectly and employees didn't get what they wanted. The new PRS should make things much better.

For this script and with two people, one person can play the promoted employee and the other the manager. The manager has been testing the PRS system for some time and knows the functionality it provides. While the manager is describing the features of PRS, the employee runs the keyboard.

## Empl gets promoted to managment and the new office wing and needs furniture for an empty office

Because a wing of the building has been recently remodeled, the offices are empty. The recently promoted employee gets to pick out furniture and supplies for the new office using the newly implemented PRS. The employee's manager steps the employee with using PRS

The new employee's login info has already been entered into the system so (s)he is ready to log in.

## Enter PR for desk, chair, bookcase and sets to review

The employee create a new request which automatically assigns him/her as the owner. After the request is created, the products and quantities are added to the lines. The price for a product is built into the system.

The employee needs a (first-line) manager's desk, chair, and a bookcase. The employee mistakenly request a senior level manager's chair when selecting the products. The system has a finite set of products that can be requested from their selected vendors.

Once the products are selected, the manager tells the employee the request must be reviewed by a reviewer in purchasing for approval. After the request is set to review, the manager and employee go to lunch.

## Mgr reviews PR and rejects because one item too expensive

The employee (doubles as the purchasing manager and reviewer) routinly reviews requests. (S)he reviews the employees request and sees that the employee ordered a senior-level manager's chair which is not permitted so (s)he rejects the request with an appropriate rejection reason.

## Empl modifies PR selecting lower cost item and sets to review

The manger and employee come back from lunch, checks on the status of the request and sees it has been rejected because of the chair. So the manager tells the employee to select a less costly chair and set the request to review status again. Then off to a cup of coffee.

## Mgr reviews PR again and approves

The purchasing manager sees the request has been set to review again. The changed request includes a change in the chair which is in-line with what the new manager can order. The reviewer approves the request.

The manager and employee return from coffee and see the request approved. Then the manager realizes that the employee will need some paper, pens and folders for the work. The approved request should not be changed so a new request is entered and supplies totaling <= $50. The manager explains that requests totaling less then $50 are automatically approved.

## Empl enters new PR foe paper, pens, and folders total under $50

The employee enters a new request for supplies that total less then $50. 

## Empl sets to review and PR approved automatically

When the request is set to review, it is automatically approved
